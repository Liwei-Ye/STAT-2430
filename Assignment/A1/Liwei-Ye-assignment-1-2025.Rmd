Instructions

For assignment 1, complete the following tasks

* Add your name and today's date up at the top of this file * Install the `palmerpenguins` package, unless you've already installed it, by clicking the yellow message at the top of the editing window, or using the Tools > Install packages... menu
* Familiarize yourself with the `penguins` dataset in the next section.
* Draw a plot and refine it twice using the methods from Lesson 5 Making your first plot as directed below
* Before knitting this file, make sure for each figure to:
-describe the figure you plan to show, 
-show your R code for the figure
-show the output of your R code
-say a sentence or 2 about each figure (interpretation)

## Look at the data

Here is a condensed overview of the `penguins` data

```{r}
str(penguins)
```
and an overview of the `penguins_raw` supplementary data.

```{r}
str(penguins_raw)
```

We will use the penguins dataset.

## New visualization

### Step 1 (3 pts)

<!--

q1.1

Write a R code (1 line) that print the names of the columns of the penguins dataset. [0.5 pts]

-->


```{r}
print(colnames(palmerpenguins::penguins))
```


<!--

q1.2

Create a scatterplot of bill length (on the x axis) and bill depth (on the y axis).
Make the simplest plot you can, using just `ggplot`, `aes` and `geom_point`. [1.5 pts]

-->



```{r}
# Scatter Plot of Penguins' Bill Length (on the X-Axis) and Bill Depth (on the Y-Axis)
ggplot(
  data = na.omit(palmerpenguins::penguins),  
  mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point()
```


<!--
q1.3

Write 1 sentence that describes what you see (or do not see)  in your plot [1 pt]
-->
The plot shows there are three distinct clustering patterns based on the penguins' bill length and depth, and the most of the penguins Bill Length that around 40 - 50 mm, their Bill Depth within interval of 12.5 - 18.75 mm

### Step 2 (2 pts)

<!--
q2.1

Refine your previous plot, adding color or shape to indicate the species. Just do the minimal change. (2 pts)
-->


```{r}
# Scatter Plot of Penguins' Bill Length (on the X-Axis) and Bill Depth (on the Y-Axis)
ggplot(
  data = na.omit(palmerpenguins::penguins),  
  mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Adelie" = "red", "Chinstrap" = "green", "Gentoo" = "blue"))
```


<!--

q2.2

Replace this sentence with a 1 sentence description of the new information revealed by this addition. (1 pt)
-->
Three penguin species show distinct clustering patterns based on their bill length and depth, with Gentoo Penguins generally having higher bill length and lower bill depth value, Adelie Penguins having lower bill length and higher bill depth value, and Chinstrap Penguins showing intermediate bill traits compared with the other two species.


### Step 3 (2 pts)

<!--

q3.1

Refine your plot by adding informative and readable axis labels and a brief title for the plot.
-->


```{r}
# Scatter Plot of Penguins' Bill Length (X-Axis), Bill Depth (Y-Axis) and Species (Color)
ggplot(
  data = na.omit(palmerpenguins::penguins),  
  mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(
    title = "Scatter Plot of Penguins' Bill Length and Bill Depth",
    x = "Bill Length (mm)",
    y = "Bill Depth (mm)",
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Adelie" = "red", "Chinstrap" = "green", "Gentoo" = "blue"))
```


## Another comparison 

<!--

q4 (2 pts)

Make any additional plot of your choice to illustrate another aspect of the comparison of penguins morphologies across species 
-->


```{r}
# Scatter Plot of Penguins': Body Mass (X-Axis), Flipper Length (Y-Axis), Species (color), Island (shape)
ggplot(
  data = na.omit(penguins),  
  mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species, shape = island)) +
  geom_point(size = 1.5, alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Scatter Plot of Palmer Penguin's Body Mass, Flipper Length, Species and Island",
    x = "Body Mass (g)",
    y = "Flipper Length (mm)",
    color = "Species of Penguin",
    shape = "Island"
  ) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Adelie" = "blue", "Chinstrap" = "red", "Gentoo" = "green")) + 
  theme_minimal()
```


<!--

q5 Knit and submit Rmd+pdf (1 pt)

Knit your work to pdf (click "knit" in the menu just at the top of the editing window).

If knitting does not work, spot the line with an error, fix the error in your Rmd file, then reknit. Iterate this procedure until until there are no errors and knitting finishes.

If knitting to pdf does not work, knit to html, load the html in your web browser and use the print function of your browser to print your html file 'as pdf'.

Once done, upload two files, (one after the other): your Rmd file and the knitted pdf.

DO NOT FORGET TO REPLACE your name and banner id in the header of this file, but do NOT mess up the header!

Pushing your report to github [Unmarked but do it!]

Stage, commit and push your final .Rmd and your .html file to your GitHub repository (as done in W2 task number 3- see instructions on Brightspace>Week 2).
